Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

My name is Gopal Sreedharan.
Module of my choice is Algorithm Analysis
I am yet to learn on this module. But as a basic study of these it tells that this analaysis helps to evaluate the performance of different algorithms, and data structures and choose the most efficient and effective one for a particular task.
